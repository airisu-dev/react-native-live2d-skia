## Requirements

- React Native v0.76.0 or higher
- Node 18.0.0 or higher

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To Support `Nitro Views` you need to install React Native version v0.78.0 or higher.

## Installation

```bash
npx expo install @airisu-dev/react-native-live2d-skia react-native-nitro-modules react-native-skia react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets react-native-gesture-handler expo-asset expo-file-system
```

Expo apps only (development builds with prebuild); the React Native CLI isn't supported.

Skia: either version works; install one, not both.

| Skia | Package                              | Renderer                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| v3   | `react-native-skia` (3.3+)           | Graphite (Vulkan, Metal) |
| v2   | `@shopify/react-native-skia` (2.10+) | Ganesh (OpenGL, Metal)   |

For v2, install `@shopify/react-native-skia` instead of `react-native-skia` above, at 2.10 or later: `expo install` picks 2.6.2 for SDK 57, which hands Skia objects to C++ differently (JSI host objects, not native state), so pin a newer one, e.g. `npx expo install @shopify/react-native-skia@2.14.0`. The config plugin reads which one the app depends on, and models are drawn in C++ with it.

### Cubism SDK for Native

The package doesn't include Live2D's Cubism SDK: its Core is proprietary, and
each app downloads it from Live2D, accepting
[Live2D's license terms](https://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-proprietary-software-license-agreement_en.html).
1. Download it (it's checked against a SHA-256):

   ```bash
   npx @airisu-dev/react-native-live2d-skia fetch-sdk --accept-license   # or bunx, yarn, pnpm
   ```

   It extracts to `./vendor/CubismSdkForNative` (change it with `--out`). Add `/vendor/` to `.gitignore`, so it's never in a public repo. On EAS Build,
   run the same command in an `eas-build-post-install` script.

2. Point the config plugin at it, in `app.json`:

   ```json
   "plugins": [["@airisu-dev/react-native-live2d-skia", { "cubismSdkPath": "./vendor/CubismSdkForNative" }]]
   ```

3. `npx expo prebuild`, then build. A missing or unsupported SDK stops the build with the path it looked at.

Publishing an app built on the SDK may also need Live2D's
[Cubism SDK Release License](https://www.live2d.com/en/sdk/license/) (businesses above 10M JPY a year).
